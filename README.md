## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (at least version 15)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Steps

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.

Clone the project repository from Github:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:corecodeio/todo-api.git
```

Navigate to the cloned repository:

```bash
$ cd todo-api
```

Install the required packages using npm:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Run the project in development mode:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

This command will start your application in development mode and you should see a message in the console that says "Server started on port 8000". You can now access your application by visiting http://localhost:8000 in your web browser. You will see the documentation there.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up the project on your local machine.ðŸŽ‰
